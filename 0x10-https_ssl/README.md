Introduction
This project aims to showcase the configuration of HAProxy to handle encrypted traffic, enforce HTTPS, and automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. It provides an example HAProxy configuration file and demonstrates how to set up SSL termination and redirection.

Requirements
HAProxy version 1.5 or higher
Basic knowledge of HAProxy configuration
SSL certificate for the domain/subdomain
Setup
Install HAProxy:
Ensure that HAProxy version 1.5 or higher is installed on your system. If not, install it using your system's package manager.

SSL Certificate:
Obtain an SSL certificate for your domain or subdomain. You can use Certbot or other certificate providers to acquire a valid SSL certificate.

HAProxy Configuration:
Update the HAProxy configuration file (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg) with the provided configuration to enable SSL termination and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

Restart HAProxy:
Restart HAProxy to apply the configuration changes.

Configuration
The provided HAProxy configuration (100-redirect_http_to_https) includes settings to enforce HTTPS, redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, and handle SSL termination. Follow the instructions in the configuration file to adapt it to your specific domain and SSL certificate.

Usage
After configuring HAProxy, it will automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS and handle SSL termination. Users will receive a 301 Moved Permanently response for HTTP requests, enforcing secure HTTPS traffic.
