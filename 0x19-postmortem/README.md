Duration:
Start Time: January 26, 2024, 10:30 AM UTC
End Time: January 26, 2024, 2:45 PM UTC

Impact:
Service Affected: User Authentication System
User Experience: 75% of users experienced login failures - a worldwide protest against password validation!

Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage: Our load balancer was on a coffee break, sipping on unevenly distributed lattes, resulting in a chaotic login mess.

Timeline:

Detection Time:
January 26, 2024, 10:45 AM UTC

Detection Method:
Monitoring alerts screaming louder than a teenager at a rock concert due to a suspicious increase in failed login attempts.

Actions Taken:

Investigated the authentication service logs like detectives chasing the culprit in a crime novel.
Assumed it was a DDoS attack – turns out, it was just our server trying to social distance itself.
Checked database server health because, you know, databases have feelings too.
Misleading Paths:

Explored the rabbit hole of database issues, only to find Alice and the Mad Hatter having tea.
Investigated recent code deployments, suspecting a bug - found a caterpillar, but no bugs.
Escalation:

Incident escalated to the System Engineering and DevOps teams because superhero capes were needed.
Resolution:

Identified the load balancer sipping coffee unevenly.
Fixed it by giving the load balancer a good talking-to and adjusting its attitude.
Verified changes and celebrated with a victory dance.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The load balancer was playing favorites, sending more traffic to some servers and less to others. Classic case of office politics in the digital world.

Resolution:
Fixed by reconfiguring the load balancer settings, ensuring it treats all servers equally – a digital equality movement.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements:

Regular load balancer therapy sessions to address any emotional imbalances.
Monitoring alerts with a sense of humor - nobody likes a boring alert.
Develop a load balancer reality TV show - "Keeping Up with the Balancers."
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Post-incident review with popcorn and a remote control to rewind the chaos.
Update documentation with load balancer best practices, including a chapter on coffee breaks.
Team training on load balancer diplomacy and conflict resolution.
Automated tests to ensure our load balancer doesn't moonlight as a talent show judge.

Conclusion:
In the grand saga of digital mishaps, the Great Login Fiasco taught us the importance of balanced friendships, even for our load balancers. Stay tuned for more tech tales, where servers have personalities, databases have tea parties, and postmortems are the real blockbuster hits!
